# Automated Detection of Animals in the Arava Valley

**Collaborators:** Etay Lorberboym, Tamir Bar-Tov

## Description:
This repository hosts the Python notebooks and codebase for the ambitious project aimed at analyzing traffic camera images from the Arava Valley to identify animal movements across the region. The project combines advanced image processing tools, pre-trained models like YOLO, and segmentation techniques to detect and categorize various animals native to Israel. 

**Inside this repo:**
- An image processing tool designed for both academic researchers and amateur nature enthusiasts.
- An extensive dataset categorized by seasons with detailed annotations.
- A streamlined Colab-based pipeline that allows for effortless data import via Dropbox and processes images to output detailed detections.
- A directional analysis tool to discern an animal's movement direction across the Arava Valley border fence.

## Key Features:
- Type-Level Animal Identification with focus on species: Dog, Cat, Bird, Fox, Jackal, Gazelle, and Hare.
- Directional Analysis to detect animals' movement trends.
- User-friendly tools hosted on Colab notebooks for easy data processing and predictions.
